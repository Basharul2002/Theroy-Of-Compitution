Below are examples of Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) representing different languages over the alphabet {0, 1}:

## 1. Language: {w|w is a bit string that starts with 0}
![NFA for Language 1](assets/nfa_language_1.jpg)

## 2. Language: {w|w is a bit string that ends with 1}
![NFA for Language 2](assets/nfa_language_2.jpg)

## 3. Language: {w|w is a bit string that starts with 0 and ends with 1}
![NFA for Language 3](assets/nfa_language_3.jpg)

## 4. Language: {w|w has at least two 1s}
![NFA for Language 2](assets/nfa_language_4.jpg)

## 5. Language: {w|w has at most two 1s}
![NFA for Language 3](assets/nfa_language_5.jpg)


These NFA examples illustrate various language properties over the binary alphabet {0, 1}. Each NFA is designed to accept or reject strings based on the specified language criteria.

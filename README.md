## DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) <a name="dfa"></a>
The DFA implementation includes functionalities to create, manipulate, and simulate a Deterministic Finite Automaton. DFA is represented using a transition table, and operations such as acceptance of strings and minimizing DFA are supported.

## NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) <a name="nfa"></a>
The NFA implementation provides features for constructing and operating on Nondeterministic Finite Automata. It supports epsilon transitions and can simulate the behavior of NFAs for input strings.

## RE (Regular Expressions) <a name="re"></a>
Regular expressions are implemented with functionalities for pattern matching and string validation. The implementation supports basic regular expression syntax and operations such as concatenation, alternation, and closure.



## Conversions <a name="conversions"></a>
### NFA to DFA <a name="nfa-to-dfa"></a>
The NFA to DFA conversion module converts a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton to an equivalent Deterministic Finite Automaton. It applies the subset construction algorithm to generate the corresponding DFA from the given NFA.

### RE to DFA <a name="re-to-dfa"></a>
The translation of regular expressions (RE) into equivalent Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is made easier by this module. The procedure consists of processing the regular expression, building the appropriate Generalized Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (GNFA), and then using subset construction to transform the GNFA into a DFA.

### CFG to CNF <a name="cfg-to-cnf"></a>
This module handles the conversion of Context-Free Grammars (CFG) to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). It involves transforming the CFG by eliminating epsilon productions, unit productions, and non-terminal symbols with more than two productions, ultimately producing a CFG in CNF.

### PDA (Push Down Automata) <a name="pda"></a>
The Push Down Automata (PDA) implementation supports the creation and simulation of PDAs. It utilizes a stack to facilitate state transitions and recognize languages generated by Context-Free Grammars.

### CFG to PDA <a name="cfg-to-pda"></a>
This module provides functionality for converting a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to an equivalent Push Down Automaton (PDA). The conversion involves creating appropriate transitions and stack operations to mimic the behavior of the CFG.

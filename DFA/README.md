# DFA Examples

Below are examples of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) representing different languages over the alphabet {0, 1}:

## 1. Language: {w | w starts with 0}

## 3. Language: {w | w starts with 0 and ends with 1}
![DFA for Language 3](assets/dfa_language_3.png)

## 4. Language: {w | w contains an odd number of 1's}

## 5. Language: {w | w contains an even number of 0's}
![DFA for Language 5](assets/dfa_language_5.png)

## 6. Language: {w | w has at least two 1's}

## 7. Language: {w | w has at most two 1's}
![DFA for Language 7](assets/dfa_language_7.png)

## 8. Language: {w | w contains the substring 101}
![DFA for Language 8](assets/dfa_language_8.png)

## 9. Language: {w | w does not contain the substring 101}
![DFA for Language 9](assets/dfa_language_9.png)

## 10. Language: {w | the sum of all symbols in w is a multiple of 3}

These DFA examples illustrate various language properties over the binary alphabet {0, 1}. Each DFA is designed to accept or reject strings based on the specified language criteria.
